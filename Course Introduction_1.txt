About the course
Working with databases is a key skill for developers, especially those in Back-End, Full Stack, and DevOps roles. This course will teach you the fundamentals of relational databases and how to access them from your applications. 

Some of the essential application development tasks include accessing, processing, and presenting data. Data is stored in various databases, either on-premise or on the cloud, and developers will need to learn how to talk to them via programming languages. 

In this course, youâ€™ll learn about foundational database concepts and the basics of SQL, a simple and powerful programming language used for managing data.  

In addition to SQL, you will discover how Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows you to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages like Python to work with databases. You will gain full-stack Django skills by creating a Django web app to persist, process, and present data. And you will get hands-on experience deploying your Django web app on the cloud. 

Throughout this course, you will practice with hands-on labs. You will also complete a final project at the end of the course to demonstrate what you have learned and have a great addition to your portfolio!
